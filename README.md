# ultrasonic-using-HC-05-bluetooth with LED output 
NOTE : since tinkercad has delete it the HC-05 module i simulate the circuit without it but the goal has been achived 
componant : Arduino UNO R3, ultrasonic distance sensor,  HC-05, LED output, resistor
NOTE : some of the component will change during the connection "tablet instet of LED", adding HC-05 to the circuit"
